<h1>Predicting Fight Damage in Slay the Spire</h1>
<p>
  Slay the Spire is a deck-building video game where you face rounds of monsters, upgrading and swapping out cards in your deck as you go.
  For my final project, I extended a mod for the game Slay the Spire that predicts the best action to take at each point in the game. 
  This is a turn based game with deck-building, buying, and action phases, so the model is capable of recommending the best card to play during fights and best new card and relic to choose during buy phases. 
  I found an existing mod that does exactly this, but I wanted to experiment with different network architectures and train the model on a new dataset released after the original mod was published.
  The new dataset was much larger and allowed for improvements in test accuracy compared to the original model. I was also able to win a game using only actions recommended by the mod.
</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>
The overall problem is to improve on the Slay-I mod for Slay the Spire to better predict damage taken during fights. 
The first goal is to reduce overfitting, an issue that the original author mentioned, by adding embedding, experimenting with batch size, and adding dropout layers.
The second goal is to preprocess a new dataset and train the original model on it, comparing training loss over number of epochs with the model trained on the original dataset.

</p>

<h2>Related Work</h2>

<p>
This project is based on the Slay-I mod, created by Alex Driedger. He has published the code for the model, as well as the code to load the saved model into the mod.

The original datasets used for training and testing the mod were the Spire Logs dataset and the Jorbs dataset.

A couple months after the original mod was written, the creators of Slay the Spire published a huge collection of over 75 million runs. 
</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>
  First, I trained the original model to get a baseline train and test accuracy to compare with. As the original author mentioned, I saw signs of overfitting, so I experimented with various ways to reduce this.
  I tried adding embeddings for cards and relics, varying the batch size, and adding dropout layers.
  Once I arrived at a model less prone to overfitting, I trained it on 5 million runs from the new dataset.
</p>


<h2>Experiments</h2>

<p>
  To get a baseline, I trained the original model over 20 epochs and noticed strong signs of overfitting: the training loss decreased on a nice curve, but validation loss stopped decreasing much after around 5 epochs.

</p>

<h3>Adding Embedding</h3>
<p>
  The goal of embedding is to tranform sparse one-hot encoded vectors into an embedding matrix. This is helpful in cases with large dictionaries (like English words), which is not a concern here. 
  However, it also helps the model learn relationships between inputs, which is especially relevant for Slay the Spire as certain cards/relics synergize well and upgraded cards should be associated with each other.

</p>

<h3>Varying Batch Size</h3>

<h3>Adding Dropout Layers</h3>

<h2>Results</h2>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<h2>Future Work</h2>

<p>
  The next big step would be to incorporate all 75 million runs of the new dataset. 
  I only used a subset of these to keep things manageable while I experimented with other network parameters, but I would want to make use of all the data available to further better the model.
